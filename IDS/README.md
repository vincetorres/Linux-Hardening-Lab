# IDS Setup (Snort)

## Objective
Install and configure Snort as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats. The setup will include configuring a test ICMP rule and setting up alert output for notification.

## Steps

### 1. **Snort Installed**
   - Install Snort on the system:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install snort
     ```

### 2. **Snort Running**
   - Run Snort with the specific configuration and interface (replace `eth0` with your network interface):
     ```bash
     snort -c /etc/snort/snort.lua -i eth0
     ```

### 3. **ICMP Rule Config**
   - Configure Snort to monitor ICMP traffic by editing the rules file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
     # Add an ICMP rule to monitor ICMP traffic
     alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"ICMP traffic detected"; sid:1000001;)
     ```

### 4. **Alert Output Config**
   - Configure Snort to output alerts to a log file for monitoring:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.lua
     # Enable unified2 output for alert logs
     output alert_unified2: filename snort.alert, limit 128
     ```


     

## Results
- Snort is installed and running.
- ICMP traffic is being monitored by the configured rule.
- Alerts are output to a log file for review and analysis.
